            <h2>The History</h2>
            <p class="text-overlay">Long ago, dragons were once the rulers of the skies, their wisdom and power unmatched. Among them, a special lineage gave birth to twins—one representing greed and courage, the other representing kindness and innocence. These twins, named Voltrax and Spherine, were raised by their parents in a hidden forest on the mystical planet of Drakoria, located in the Andromeda Galaxy.</p>
            <h2>The Legacy of Drakoria</h2>
            <p class="text-overlay">Drakoria was a world filled with vibrant landscapes, floating mountains, and enchanted forests. It was here that Kaedros and Lyriana taught their children the importance of balance between power and compassion, hoping that together, the twins would bring harmony to the world of dragons. However, their idyllic existence was shattered by the encroaching darkness of war.</p>
            <h2>The Great War</h2>
            <p class="text-overlay">As the influence of dragons began to wane, a war broke out between the dragons and a fierce race known as the Khadarians. The Khadarians, driven by their desire for dominance and the precious resources of Drakoria, launched a brutal campaign against the dragon clans. Kaedros and Lyriana fought valiantly to protect their kind, but the conflict proved devastating.

                In a final desperate battle, the dragons united against the Khadarians, but the cost was heavy. Many dragons fell, including Kaedros and Lyriana, who ultimately sacrificed themselves to save their children. In their last moments, they harnessed the ancient magic of Drakoria, creating a powerful spell that would allow Seraphine to escape the impending doom.</p>
            <h2>A New Destiny</h2>
            <p class="text-overlay">With tears in her eyes, Lyriana sent Seraphine away, using the spell to transport her to a distant galaxy—the Milky Way, specifically to the planet known as Earth. “You must find a way to carry our legacy,” Lyriana urged, her voice filled with both hope and sorrow. “You are the heart of our lineage, Seraphine.”

                As the portal opened, Voltrax, tempted by his greed and thirst for power, hesitated. He believed that by staying, he could somehow reclaim their lost heritage and avenge their fallen kin. But the magic pulled Seraphine away just in time, leaving Voltrax to face an uncertain fate. The portal closed, and he vanished into the shadows of Drakoria, his ultimate destiny unknown.</p>
            <h2>A Divided Legacy</h2>
            <p class="text-overlay">Now, with their parents gone and the war concluded, Seraphine found herself alone in a new world, burdened with the memories of her past and the weight of her lineage. She hoped to find peace and healing among the creatures of Earth, protecting those in need and spreading kindness, as her mother had taught her.

                Meanwhile, Voltrax, in the depths of despair and ambition, wandered the remnants of Drakoria, searching for power and treasure. The divide between the twins grew, with Seraphine embodying compassion and healing, while Voltrax descended into the shadows, haunted by his desire for dominance.
                
                As the last of their kind, Seraphine and Voltrax stood at a crossroads—one destined for peace, the other for power. The fate of their dragon lineage rested on their shoulders. The world watched as they struggled to decide: would they find a way to unite and honor their parents’ legacy, or would their differences ultimately tear them apart?</p>
